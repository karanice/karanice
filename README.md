## Hello!

My name is Anna, I'm a beginner **backend-developer** (Django, Flask).

## Training projects

I graduated *Hexlet* online programming school, so here's some projects I finished during my studies:

- [web-app for managing tasks](https://github.com/karanice/python-project-52)
- [web-app for short SEO-analysis](https://github.com/karanice/python-project-83)
- [cli-app for finding the difference between two tree structures (json, yaml)](https://github.com/karanice/python-project-50)
- [set of short math games for brain training](https://github.com/karanice/python-project-49)

## Current projects

Iâ€™m currently working on a web-app [*Aneway*](https://github.com/karanice/aneway). It will be an aggregator of local events and organizations (mostly free, Saint-Petersburg only at the start), so people like me (creative, bored... a bit cheapskates) might always find some fascinating way to spend their day off.

## Graduation

Bachelor of Physics, Saint-Petersburg State University, 2019-2024 \
I belonged to the Department of Radio Physics, and my diploma was about computer modelling solar chromosphere by radio observations.
